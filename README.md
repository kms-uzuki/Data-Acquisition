# Data Acquisition
This project is a collection of code for use by UCLA's Formula SAE Data Acquisition team.
Using a series of breakout sensors and Arduinos, we can create an inexpensive data logger that displays and/or records sensor information collected.

This code was created specifically for the [Copernicus II DIP](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11858 "Copernicus II Breakout"),  the [LSM9DS1 IMU](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13284 "LMS9DS1 Breakout"), and the [Level Shifting microSD](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13743 "Level Shifter microSD Breakout") from Sparkfun Electronics. As a prerequisite, the [LSM9DS1 library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library) should be downloaded.
